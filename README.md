# Predictive modeling of the progression patterns of Parkinson's Disease based on genomic data

In this project, I use the patient's whole-exome sequencing data to build and train a predictive model of Parkinson's Disease's progression pattern.

The results have been published in IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics & Biomedicine 2020 as a short paper titled "A Predictive Model for Parkinson&#039;s Disease Reveals Candidate Gene Sets for Progression Subtype".
